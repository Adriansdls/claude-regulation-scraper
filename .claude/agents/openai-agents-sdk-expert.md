Here is some information about the OpenAI Agents SDK:
OpenAI Agents SDK (Python) — Schematic Brief
0) Install & Setup

pip install openai-agents (voice features: pip install "openai-agents[voice]") 
OpenAI GitHub
+1
GitHub

Python ≥ 3.9. Set OPENAI_API_KEY env var. 
OpenAI GitHub
OpenAI Platform

python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install openai-agents
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

1) Mental Model (primitives)

Agent = LLM + instructions (+ tools, handoffs, guardrails, output schema). 
OpenAI GitHub

Runner = execution loop: think → (optional) tool Action → Observation → repeat → final output. 
OpenAI Platform

Tool = Python function (or hosted tool) callable by the agent via function-calling. 
OpenAI Platform

Session/Thread = conversation state/memory across turns. 
OpenAI Platform

Handoff = agent-to-agent delegation (a special tool type). 
OpenAI

Guardrails = validate/stop/shape I/O. 
OpenAI GitHub

2) Hello, Agent
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a concise, helpful assistant.",
    # model="gpt-4o-mini",  # optional: pick a model & settings
)

res = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
print(res.final_output)


The Runner drives multi-step reasoning and any tool calls until the final answer. 
OpenAI Platform

3) Tools (function calls)

Define Python functions as tools with schema inferred from type hints/docstring.

from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Return a brief weather report for the given city."""
    # (Stub; normally call an external API)
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

agent = Agent(
    name="WeatherAssistant",
    instructions="Use tools when needed for accurate info.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

print(Runner.run_sync(agent, "What's the weather in Tokyo?").final_output)


Tips:

Clear docstrings = better tool selection.

Return simple serializable types (str / Pydantic, etc.).

Hosted tools (e.g., WebSearch, Code Interpreter) can be added similarly. 
OpenAI Platform

4) Multi-Tool Reasoning
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool

@function_tool
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers."""
    return a + b

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Weather report."""
    return f"{city}: Sunny."

agent = Agent(
    name="MultiTool",
    instructions="Do math and look up weather.",
    tools=[add_numbers, get_weather],
)

q = "What is 3+5? Also, what's the weather in Paris?"
print(Runner.run_sync(agent, q).final_output)


Planner is LLM-driven; SDK loops until done. 
OpenAI Platform

5) Memory / Threads

Use a Session to persist conversation context.

from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

agent   = Agent(name="QA", instructions="Be brief.")
session = SQLiteSession("thread_123")

print(Runner.run_sync(agent, "City of the Golden Gate Bridge?", session=session).final_output)
# "San Francisco"

print(Runner.run_sync(agent, "What state is it in?", session=session).final_output)
# "California"


Same session ID = same thread/history. 
OpenAI Platform

6) Handoffs (multi-agent)

Route to the right specialist agent.

from agents import Agent, Runner

spanish = Agent(name="ES", instructions="Responde solo en español.")
english = Agent(name="EN", instructions="Respond only in English.")

triage = Agent(
    name="Triage",
    instructions="Detect Spanish vs English; handoff appropriately.",
    handoffs=[spanish, english],
)

print(Runner.run_sync(triage, "Hola, ¿cómo estás?").final_output)


Handoffs are a special tool kind; execution switches to the target agent. 
OpenAI

7) Guardrails (I/O constraints)

Typical flow: add validation to stop/shape output (e.g., length/content/schema). See quickstart’s “Add a guardrail.” 
OpenAI GitHub

8) Output Schemas (structured answers)

Constrain the final output to a schema (Pydantic/JSON). The loop continues until model emits valid structure. (See docs’ structured output examples.) 
OpenAI Platform

9) Observability / Traces

Enable traces to debug steps (prompts, tool calls, observations, handoffs). View via built-in tracing & third-party integrations (cookbook examples show Langfuse, etc.). 
OpenAI GitHub
OpenAI Cookbook

10) Realtime & Voice (optional)

Realtime agents (voice) = same SDK + Realtime API; install voice extras. (Beta; API may change.) 
OpenAI GitHub
+1

11) Patterns & Gotchas

Keep tools small, single-purpose, well-documented → better tool use.

Return concise, model-friendly strings or typed objects.

Use sessions for chat apps; unique session per end-user thread.

Use handoffs to compose experts; give each clear role and handoff_description. 
OpenAI GitHub

Cap loops (e.g., max_turns) to avoid runaway reasoning. 
OpenAI Platform

Prefer hosted tools for common needs (search, code), custom tools for system integration. 
OpenAI Platform

12) End-to-End Mini “App” (single file)
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession, function_tool

@function_tool
def top_k(xs: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:
    """Return the top-k numbers from xs in descending order."""
    return sorted(xs, reverse=True)[:k]

@function_tool
def wiki_stub(topic: str) -> str:
    """Return a one-line summary for a topic (stub)."""
    return f"{topic}: [summary placeholder]"

analyst = Agent(
    name="Analyst",
    instructions=(
        "You analyze lists and look up concepts as needed. "
        "Always cite which tools you used."
    ),
    tools=[top_k, wiki_stub],
    # model_settings={"temperature": 0},  # optional
)

session = SQLiteSession("demo_thread")

user_q = "Given [5,1,8,3], top 2 numbers; then summarize 'PageRank'."
res = Runner.run_sync(analyst, user_q, session=session)
print(res.final_output)

13) Where to look in docs (for an LLM)

Quickstart (install → first agent → handoffs → guardrails → traces). 
OpenAI GitHub

Core API examples (Agent, Runner.run_sync, function tools, sessions). 
OpenAI Platform

Handoffs concept (delegation as tool). 
OpenAI

Realtime/Voice quickstarts (optional). 
OpenAI GitHub

14) One-screen Checklist (for generation)

 Define Agent: name, instructions, (model), [tools], [handoffs], [guardrails], [output_type]. 
OpenAI GitHub

 Define @function_tool functions; keep docstrings crisp; ensure serializable returns. 
OpenAI Platform

 Run with Runner (run_sync/run); rely on loop to manage actions/observations. 
OpenAI Platform

 Persist context with Session for multi-turn threads. 
OpenAI Platform

 Compose with handoffs for domain experts. 
OpenAI

 Add guardrails, tracing; cap turns.
