Commencement InformationI39S. 34 in force at 25.5.2018 by S.I. 2018/625, reg. 2(1)(c)35The first data protection principleU.K.(1)The first data protection principle is that the processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes must be lawful and fair. (2)The processing of personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes is lawful only if and to the extent that it is based on law and either\u2014 (a)the data subject has given consent to the processing for that purpose, or (b)the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for that purpose by a competent authority. (3)In addition, where the processing for any of the law enforcement purposes is sensitive processing, the processing is permitted only in the two cases set out in subsections (4) and (5). (4)The first case is where\u2014 (a)the data subject has given consent to the processing for the law enforcement purpose as mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and (b)at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place (see section 42). (5)The second case is where\u2014 (a)the processing is strictly necessary for the law enforcement purpose, (b)the processing meets at least one of the conditions in Schedule 8, and (c)at the time when the processing is carried out, the controller has an appropriate policy document in place (see section 42).

(2)Paragraph (b) of the second data protection principle is subject to subsections (3) and (4). (3)Personal data collected for a law enforcement purpose may be processed for any other law enforcement purpose (whether by the controller that collected the data or by another controller) provided that\u2014 (a)the controller is authorised by law to process the data for the other purpose, and (b)the processing is necessary and proportionate to that other purpose. (4)Personal data collected for any of the law enforcement purposes may not be processed for a purpose that is not a law enforcement purpose unless the processing is authorised by law.

(2)In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, personal data based on facts must, so far as possible, be distinguished from personal data based on personal assessments. (3)In processing personal data for any of the law enforcement purposes, a clear distinction must, where relevant and as far as possible, be made between personal data relating to different categories of data subject, such as\u2014 (a)persons suspected of having committed or being about to commit a criminal offence; (b)persons convicted of a criminal offence; (c)persons who are or may be victims of a criminal offence; (d)witnesses or other persons with information about offences. (4)All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data which is inaccurate, incomplete or no longer up to date is not transmitted or made available for any of the law enforcement purposes. (5)For that purpose\u2014 (a)the quality of personal data must be verified before it is transmitted or made available, (b)in all transmissions of personal data, the necessary information enabling the recipient to assess the degree of accuracy, completeness and reliability of the data and the extent to which it is up to date must be included, and (c)if, after personal data has been transmitted, it emerges that the data was incorrect or that the transmission was unlawful, the recipient must be notified without delay.

(2)The controller has an appropriate policy document in place in relation to the sensitive processing if the controller has produced a document which\u2014 (a)explains the controller's procedures for securing compliance with the data protection principles (see section 34(1)) in connection with sensitive processing in reliance on the consent of the data subject or (as the case may be) in reliance on the condition in question, and (b)explains the controller's policies as regards the retention and erasure of personal data processed in reliance on the consent of the data subject or (as the case may be) in reliance on the condition in question, giving an indication of how long such personal data is likely to be retained. (3)Where personal data is processed on the basis that an appropriate policy document is in place, the controller must during the relevant period\u2014 (a)retain the appropriate policy document, (b)review and (if appropriate) update it from time to time, and (c)make it available to the Commissioner, on request, without charge.
